Annotations are basically maps, from keys to bits of the annotation, such as the parse, the part-of-speech tags, or named entity tags. Annotators are a lot like functions, except that they operate over Annotations instead of Objects. They do things like tokenize, parse, or NER tag sentences. Annotators and Annotations are integrated by AnnotationPipelines, which create sequences of generic Annotators. Stanford CoreNLP inherits from the AnnotationPipeline class, and is customized with NLP Annotators."; // Add your text here!
